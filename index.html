			<blockquote>Say it's Tuesday. You've had a hard day at work and don't feel like joining your friends at the gym. Your Nokia communicator flashes a message that the latest Aki Kaurismäki movie is playing tonight at the local art house — the HVV system knows you might be interested because you went to see Leningrad Cowboys Meet Moses by the same director last week. So you message a friend who might want to go, too. She replies that she's already bought a ticket. With the aid of a seating plan that appears on your communicator screen, you not only book your admission but rebook hers, picking two seats in the middle of a row. The system alerts your friends that you won't be working out tonight and your home heating system that you'll be returning later than usual. Then it adds the fact that you're clearly nuts about Finnish auteurs to its ever-evolving list of your tastes and habits — maybe even notifying you that a movie club has formed in your apartment building. Would you like to join? Meanwhile, you haven't returned the message your mom left you at work; she wants to discuss her plans for Dad's surprise birthday party. Because she lives in Arabianranta and you've allowed her access to some parts of your HVV profile, she can see that you've gone to the movies tonight, sparing you a "Where are you?" scold on your voicemail.</blockquote>

	    <!--
        
	        So to make a summary of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:
        
	        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` -- they define the position of **the center** of step element on
	            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
	        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` -- they define the rotation of
	            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
	            are exactly the same;
	        * `data-scale` -- defines the scale of step element; default value is 1
        
	        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
	        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform
        
	    -->
	    <div id="overview" class="step" data-x="3000" data-y="1500" data-scale="10">
	    </div>

	</div>

	<!--
    
	    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.
    
	    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.
    
	    When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
	    gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
	    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
	    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.
    
	    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
	    the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.
    
	    ...
    
	    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
	    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
	    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
	    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.
    
	    Just sayin' ;)
    
	-->
	<div class="hint">
	    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate</p>
	</div>
	<script>
	if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) { 
	    document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>";
	}
	</script>

	<!--
    
	    Last, but not least.
    
	    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
	    I strongly encourage to minify it first.
    
	    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.
    
	    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
	    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
	    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
	    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
    
	-->
	<!--
    
	    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.
    
	    Just store the result of the call:
    
	        var api = impress();
    
	    and you will get three functions you can call:
    
	        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
	        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
	        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
	        `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
	                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
	                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.
    
	    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
	    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.
    
	    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
	    is used in event handlers.

<!--
    
    Now you know more or less everything you need to build your first impress.js presentation, but before
    you start...
    
    Oh, you've already cloned the code from GitHub?
    
    You have it open in text editor?
    
    Stop right there!
    
    That's not how you create awesome presentations. This is only a code. Implementation of the idea that
    first needs to grow in your mind.
    
    So if you want to build great presentation take a pencil and piece of paper. And turn off the computer.
    
    Sketch, draw and write. Brainstorm your ideas on a paper. Try to build a mind-map of what you'd like
    to present. It will get you closer and closer to the layout you'll build later with impress.js.
    
    Get back to the code only when you have your presentation ready on a paper. It doesn't make sense to do
    it earlier, because you'll only waste your time fighting with positioning of useless points.
    
    If you think I'm crazy, please put your hands on a book called "Presentation Zen". It's all about 
    creating awesome and engaging presentations.
    
    Think about it. 'Cause impress.js may not help you, if you have nothing interesting to say.

    For real?
    
    I'm impressed! Feel free to let me know that you got that far (I'm @bartaz on Twitter), 'cause I'd like
    to congratulate you personally :)
    
    But you don't have to do it now. Take my advice and take some time off. Make yourself a cup of coffee, tea,
    or anything you like to drink. And raise a glass for me ;)
